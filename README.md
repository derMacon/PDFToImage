# PDFToImage

The program copies a previewed page of a given pdf document to the systems clipboard. Since it runs in the background the pages can be turned using hotkeys or by clicking in the preview window. 

This program will be useful when working with ankidroid so that you don't have to screenshot each page you want to make a flashcard for. Just move to the page in the preview window and the page can be pasted directly.
